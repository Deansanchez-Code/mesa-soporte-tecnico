Export getSupabaseAdmin doesn't exist in target module

The export getSupabaseAdmin was not found in module [project]/src/lib/supabase/cliente.ts [app-route] (ecmascript).
Did you mean to import supabase?
All exports of the module are statically known (It doesn't have dynamic exports). So it's known statically that the requested export doesn't exist.
